## Introduction
```diff 
Better | Health | Care 
```

This project is a Full Stack website built using the Django framework. Better Health Care is a healthcare provision to provide patients the ability to book appointments with doctors. The users once registered can book, view and manage their appointments. If the admin declines the booking then users have the ability to rebook on another date.

Some the key functions of the services are as below:
+ Booking Appointments Online
+ Manage Appointments Options
+ Edit Appointments 
+ Delete Appointments
+ Login and Logout Facilities 
+ Register as new user
+ About Us page

## Agile Methodology
An Agile Approach was used to develop this site. This was achieved by breaking the project down into smaller tasks.
To complete the overall aim of website, 15 issues were created as specific tasks called User Stories. These User Stories are small sections of the project designed to accomplish a specific goal. Once the User Story was working effectively it was moved across the Kanban board, in the following working order.
